## **Core Features**

### **Authentication**

Quill Chronicles offers robust authentication mechanisms, allowing users to sign in using either credentials or OAuth. Google OAuth integration simplifies the login process, enhancing user convenience and security. This is implemented using NextAuth.js, ensuring a seamless and secure authentication flow. Supabase is utilized for managing authentication, providing a streamlined and secure user experience.

### **WYSIWYG Markdown Editor with AI Support**

A standout feature of Quill Chronicles is its WYSIWYG Markdown editor, which includes AI support capabilities. This editor allows users to create and format content effortlessly, combining the simplicity of Markdown with the power of a rich text editor. The AI support, powered by OpenAI's GPT models, assists users in generating content, providing suggestions, and enhancing their writing process.

Traditional keyword-based search can be limiting, especially when dealing with nuanced content. Quill Chronicles addresses this by implementing a search functionality based on embeddings. By using the Supabase embedding model `gte-small`, and  `pgvector` extension the platform can perform semantic searches, delivering more accurate and contextually relevant results to the users. This approach ensures a deeper understanding of the content and significantly improves the search experience.

A vibrant blogging platform thrives on user interaction and engagement. Quill Chronicles includes a robust commenting system that allows readers to leave feedback, ask questions, and engage in discussions directly on blog posts. The system supports nested comments, enabling users to reply to specific comments and create threaded conversations. This feature is essential for fostering a sense of community and encouraging active participation from the audience.

### **Next.js for Full-Stack Development**

Quill Chronicles leverages Next.js, a React framework, to build a performant and scalable full-stack application. Next.js provides features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes, which are crucial for building a responsive and dynamic blog platform. In Quill Chronicles, server actions are predominantly used instead of route handlers, streamlining server-side logic and improving code organization. The framework's seamless integration with React ensures a robust and maintainable codebase.

### **Supabase for Database, Authentication, and Embeddings**

Supabase is chosen as the backend solution for Quill Chronicles, offering multiple functionalities:

- **Database**: Supabase provides a PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities. This simplifies database management and offers an intuitive interface for handling data operations. Its real-time subscriptions enable live updates, ensuring that users receive the latest content without needing to refresh the page.
- **Authentication**: Supabase handles user authentication, providing secure and efficient login mechanisms through credentials and OAuth.
- **Embeddings**: The Supabase embedding model `gte-small` is used to implement advanced search functionalities. This model allows for semantic search, improving the accuracy and relevance of search results.

### **Tailwind CSS for Styling**

Tailwind CSS is used for styling Quill Chronicles, allowing for rapid and responsive UI development. Tailwind's utility-first approach provides a highly customizable and consistent design system, ensuring that the application remains visually appealing and user-friendly across different devices.

### **ShadCN UI Components**

ShadCN UI components are integrated to enhance the user interface of Quill Chronicles. These components, designed to work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS, provide pre-built, accessible, and customizable UI elements that speed up the development process and maintain a high standard of design consistency.
